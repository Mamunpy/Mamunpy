1. write small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the number 42.All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.
Input: 
1
2
88
42
99
Output:
1
2
88

#CODE:::

numbers = [1, 2, 88, 42, 99]
small = min(numbers)
print(small)

2. You're given an integer N. Write a program to calculate the sum of all the digits of N.
Input
The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains an integer N.
Output
For each test case, calculate the sum of digits of N, and display it in a new line.
Input
3 
12345
31203
2123
Output
15
9
8

#CODE:::

n = int(input("please enter any number: "))
for _ in range(n):
    num = input()
    sum = 0
    for i in num:
        sum += int(i)
    print(sum)


3. Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

#CODE:::Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

num = 1
while num <= 100 :
    print(num)
    num = num + 1


For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

#CODE:::

for i in range(1, 101):

    if i % 3 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")

    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")

    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")

    else:
        print(i)
